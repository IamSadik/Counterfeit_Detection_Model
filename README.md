# Capsule Counterfeit Detection using YOLOv8

This project aims to detect and verify counterfeit medicinal capsules using a deep learning approach. Built on the YOLOv8 object detection framework, the system identifies whether a capsule is **genuine** or **counterfeit** based on visual characteristics.
